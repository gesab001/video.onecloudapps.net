137
02:16:00.000 --> 02:17:00.000
For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. Romans 8:19

138
02:17:00.000 --> 02:18:00.000

144
02:23:00.000 --> 02:24:00.000

156
02:35:00.000 --> 02:36:00.000
And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. Genesis 9:15

157
02:36:00.000 --> 02:37:00.000
And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that [is] upon the earth. Genesis 9:16

225
03:44:00.000 --> 03:45:00.000

03:47:00.000 --> 03:48:00.000

03:48:00.000 --> 03:49:00.000

230
03:49:00.000 --> 03:50:00.000
And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. Genesis 9:15

231
03:50:00.000 --> 03:51:00.000

235
03:54:00.000 --> 03:55:00.000
